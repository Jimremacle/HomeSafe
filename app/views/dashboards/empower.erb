      <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8;">The term empowerment refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is <b> the process of becoming stronger and more confident </b>, especially in controlling one's life and <b>claiming one's rights </b>. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to <b>overcome their sense of powerlessness </b> and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

      The term empowerment originates from American community psychology and is associated with the social scientist Julian Rappaport (1981). However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).

      In social work, empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of citizenship education and democratic education, empowerment is seen as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting civic engagement. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a deficit-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of continuing education and self-help</p>
